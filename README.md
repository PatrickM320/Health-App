# Length Converter


## The Plan
By creating and implementing the Length converter application for my workplace, I will be able to integrate this tool. With the workplace industry being pharmaceutical the length converter will be used in the labs for accurate measurement of particle sizes or in the manufacturing teams for packaging material measurements, these are just 2 examples of how this tool can be utilised in the industry. The measurements that the tool will work with are:
* Inches
* Centimetres 
* Meters
Inches, centimetres, and meters have been used here as in the pharmaceutical industry these will offer flexible measurement options for global standards to ensure accurate and standard product measurements across different regions 

## Application Requirements 
Functional Requirements:
•	Length Conversions – The application must convert between Inches, Centimetres, and Metres.
•	User Input Handling – The application must allow users to input any numerical values for lengths in any of the lengths.
•	Error Handling – User input must be validated to ensure it is a valid number. Errors should be displayed for invalid inputs such as negative numbers.
•	User Interface – Real-Time Conversion – The application must perform the conversions and display the results immediately after the user enters a value, providing real-time feedback.

Non-Functional Requirements:
•	Performance – The application must load quickly and perform real-time conversions without noticeable delays.
•	Compatibility – The application must be compatible with major browsers and work seamlessly on various devices, including desktops and laptops.
•	User Interface- The Responsive Design UI ensures the app adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing an optimal experience. 
•	Usability – The application must have a clear, an easy-to-use interface, to ensure that users can quickly input and convert lengths correctly.
•	Reliability – The application must provide accurate length conversions between Inches, Centimetres, and Metres.

## Design
For the design I used CodePen, which helped to build the interface and visualise what I intended to build. With access to the code and able to visualise what I was building as a use of trial and error to improve the application throughout the  development phase. I chose this design after altering the code to keep a simple look but also a professional style with the colour of the outline of the box  I focussed on aiming that the colour scheme used met requirements for accessibility through following Web AIM accessibility testing services which gave me a contrast score of 7.45:1, which passes all test for text and graphical objects and UI components. Through user feedback on initial prototypes of the app, I changed the code and altered the shapes, colours and functionality of the app so it is fit for purpose and meets user requirements gathered from scientists and manufacturing who will need to use this application.
